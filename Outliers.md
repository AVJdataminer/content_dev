# How to treat outliers

We've detected the outliersâ€”now what? We need to do something with them so that they do not affect the reliability of our analysis. Broadly speaking, there are 3 approaches we can take in handling outliers:

1. We can **drop the outliers** from our dataset. 

2. We can **cap the values of the outliers** by assigning them new values.

3. We can **transform** the outliers into something harmless for our analysis.

Let's go over each approach in turn.
