## Working with Modules
Knowing what modules are and working with them can be two different things all together. So, let's breakdown how you work with modules. 

Check to see if the module you would like is installed. ` -v 

-   Importing and using modules
 

-   Dependencies
    
-   Module loading errors

## Objects
It's time to talk about something you've been using every time you write Python, but that you may not have been thinking about: objects.

You've been using objects all along because _everything in Python_ is an object. 

Integers? Objects. 

Strings? Objects. 

Lists, dictionaries, Booleans... even functions. All of these are objects.

Objects and "object-oriented programming" are deep topics that cut to the core of Python and computer science. 

Mainly, you need to recognize objects when you see them and know how to interact with them in your code. Let's practice in the below notebook.
