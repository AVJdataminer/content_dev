## Why Python?

Python is a free, open-source, and super versatile programming language. Python can be used for nearly any programming project imaginable—from web development, to database management, to data science.

Developed in the late 1980s, Python [has exploded](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/26/python-is-becoming-the-worlds-most-popular-coding-language) in popularity in recent years, particularly in the data science profession. For that reason, it's essential that you hone your Python skills for your future career. 

In this program, you will be programming in Python 3. This is the latest version of the language and the one you'd be most likely to use on the job. However, Python 2 is still used, and it's not always compatible with Python 3! You don't need to understand all [the details](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) of this incompatibility right now. But you should know this: if you're ever executing code that you found online and it's not working properly, the problem could be that the code was written for Python 2. Before troubleshooting anything else, check whether the code was written for Python 2 or Python 3.

Python's large and ever-growing user base has also developed and contributed to thousands of libraries, which are available to Python users like you. These libraries can help with many programming tasks. No matter what your program's objective is, the chances are high that there's a "package" for that!

For the remainder of this checkpoint, you'll get a high-level overview of how you should think about programming. You'll learn how programming fits into your data science toolkit, how to approach learning to program for data science, and how programming will make you stand out as a job candidate. You'll also be introduced to Jupyter Notebooks, which is the main interface you'll use to work with Python.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll modify and save a Jupyter Notebook and share it with your mentor.

## Welcome to Jupyter

Below, you'll see a Jupyter Notebook that has been embedded in the curriculum app. Broadly speaking, Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive development environment that allows you to create and share code, data, equations, and other technical and nontechnical material. You'll use Jupyter Notebooks in many checkpoints in this program.

Jupyter Notebooks are cloud-based, so you can't save files directly to your computer. Instead, you will download them and then upload them to another service. The next checkpoint will discuss those details—for now, just buckle up and enjoy your journey to Jupyter!

## Assignment

To complete this checkpoint, rework this Notebook so that it's a single cell with the following line of code in it:

```
print('Hello world from Jupyter notebooks')
```

Once you've made these changes, save this Notebook locally by clicking **File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)** at the top of the Jupyter Notebook interface. You'll save it as the file type `.ipynb`—this is the file type that is used to store Jupyter Notebooks. Save the Notebook on your computer, and name the file *hello_world_from_jupyter.ipynb*. 

Finally, upload your *hello_world_from_jupyter.ipynb* file to a place that is publicly accessible on the web, such as GitHub. Submit a link to it below to show that you're able to run, modify, save, and distribute Jupyter Notebooks.
